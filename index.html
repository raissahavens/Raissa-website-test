                        "On December 2011, my friend invited me to go to this resort hotel for us to work interview and the interview was actually a day working there so they could evaluate if we did a good job with the kids. After that first day, we worked there for the whole summer season (Dec/Jan/Fev) and every year I would go on holidays and vacation season to work with kids there."

                        "During my college years, from 2012 to 2015 I participated on the Junior Enterprise on my campus, where I started as a Marketing Analyst, became director of the Marketing team the next year and my last year, I worked as vice-president and was part of the board of counselors as well."

                    <p>
                        "On Summer 2016 I did my food science internship at Cargill, in Minneapolis. I got to work in a bakery lab, where I developed my own project for sugar reduction on breads. I did a lot of different tests and made people try the breads to see what they thought about it, we call that sensory analysis. Probably, one of the best parts of the product development."

                    <p>
                        "Before graduating, I did an internship at Ceratti, a meat processing company. I started working in the Marketing department, giving support to the product development team and making a bridge with the Research & Development department, to understand the product feautures and be able to present that to customers in the best way possible. After 5 months, I moved to the R&D team, where I was able to be inside the production plant daily, run tests, check the quality of the products and processes and technical support to customer service."
