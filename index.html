                        "On December 2011, my friend invited me to go to this resort hotel for us to work interview and the interview was actually a day working there so they could evaluate if we did a good job with the kids. After that first day, we worked there for the whole summer season (Dec/Jan/Fev) and every year I would go on holidays and vacation season to work with kids there."
